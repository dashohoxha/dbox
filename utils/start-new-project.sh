### Create a new Drupal project, using the project Labdoo as a
### template project.
###
### This new project, same as Labdoo, will contain a Drupal profile,
### make files for downloading all the needed modules, libraries,
### patches, etc. It will contain as well scripts for installing a
### minimal ubuntu server with all the packages and configurations
### needed for running a Drupal application. It will also contain
### scripts, modules, tools and docs that facilitate the development,
### including a dev-->test-->live workflow as well.
###
### The aim of this project is to be like a "Drupal-on-Rails" for
### simplifying the life of the experienced Drupal developers and for
### helping the new Drupal developers to get started.  Usually a huge
### number of skills is needed in order to complete successfully a
### Drupal project, like: server management, web stack management,
### database management, knowledge of drush, Drupal profiles,
### frequently used modules, common Drupal development patterns and
### paradigms, etc. A new Drupal developer cannot possibly get all
### this skills in a short time, so he is not able to finish properly
### a Drupal application or it will take him a very long time. This
### project offers them a Drupal solution that works out of the box,
### with reasonable settings and configurations, which they can use as
### a starting point for developing their application. This project
### can also simplify the life of the experienced Drupal developers,
### by allowing them to get started quickly, and then customizing the
### solution as they wish.
###
### This script works by renaming files and doing find/replace in
### them. There are two parameters that are used to customize the
### template project: the project name and the project prefix. In the
### template project they are represented by 'labdoo' and 'lbd', which
### are then replaced in the new project by the new project's name and
### prefix.  Why these strange names? Why not use something like
### 'example' and 'xmp', or 'sample' and 'smp', or 'template' and
### 'tmp' etc. The first reason is exactly that they are strange names
### and so there is no risk of collision with other names used in a
### project. For example 'xmp' or 'template' or 'tmp' maybe are used
### on the project for something else as well, and replacing them
### blindly with a new value may break the application. The second
### reason is that there is actually a real Drupal project with this
### name and prefix ('labdoo' and 'lbd'), and this helps to maintain
### the template project (any commit from the real project can be
### cherry picked and commited to the template project, and
### vice-versa).


### Output the usage of the script and stop it.

    echo "
